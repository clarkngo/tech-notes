It is designed to begin the online class experience by letting us know a little more about you and showing that you are participating in class. It is due at the end of the first week. Your instructor will notify City University at the end of <b>the first week</b> as to whether or not you completed your SIA.

        This textbook is heavily text based with little to no interactive elements. That means that you‚Äôre going to need to take the initiative in really understanding what you read. We‚Äôll be giving you some strategies as we go along that can help you increase your comprehension. We will be heavily using this book in this course.

        The textbook relies heavily on the reader‚Äôs knowledge of the software development lifecycle. If you are not familiar with the SDLC or you need a refresher, you will want to read this article on SDLC.

        Read Chapter 1 of Ransome & Misra. The first chapter is an introduction to the topic of the software security field. Similar to the presentation video, it introduces what we‚Äôll be learning throughout the rest of the course. One major takeaway from this chapter is the concept that the sooner security defects are identified in the process of developing software, the less costly it will be to remediate the defects. Further, defects that are identified later in the software development process are costlier to remediate.

          <br/><br/>
          You need to cite your sources in order to identify other people‚Äôs ideas and information used within your assignments. If you take or copy someone else‚Äôs words or ideas and present them as if they were your own, you are plagiarizing. Any information that is not ‚Äúcommon knowledge‚Äù must be cited. Common knowledge is information that most people know without looking it up. Common examples are ‚Äúthe sky is blue‚Äù or ‚Äúit rains a lot in Seattle.‚Äù If you‚Äôre not sure whether something is common knowledge, citing it is better than not citing it.   </details>
