Getting a `NoMethodError: undefined method street for nil:NilClass`, you can now call.
```
street = user&.address&.street
```
The above will now act the same as using dig. 
If the address is nil then street will be nil and you will need to handle the nil when you later refer to the street. 
If all the objects are present, street will be assigned correctly.
