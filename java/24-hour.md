# Java
- created in 1995 by James Gosling from Sun Microsystems (now a subsidiary of Oracle).
- open-source
- objected-oritented (OO)

Note: *"Does that also mean that my Java skills will be easily replaceable?" To improve your value and employability you need to master not only the syntax of the language, but also the right set of Java-related technologies that are in demand."*

Life Cycle of a Java Program
- requires source code of your program to be compiled first.
- then gets converted to machine-specific code or a bytecode that is understood by a run-time engine or a virtual machine.
- syntax errors checked by a Java compiler.
- libraries of Java code can be added (linked) to your program after compilation is complete (deployment stage).

Java Development Kit (JDK)
- if you plan to develop Java programs
- Two types of download
  - Java Standard Edition (SE)
  - Java Standard Enteprise Edition (EE)
    - includes server-side tools and libraries
- Note: already preinstalled on Mac OS X

Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
